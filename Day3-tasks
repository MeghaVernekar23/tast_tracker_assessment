1. Clean everything (services)

2. TASK: Tasks module (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - Pydantic models (task_name, task_desc, task_category)
    - SQLAlchemy Models
    - Task_category should be ENUMS (FITNESS, STUDY, OTHERS)
3. Tasks module should be implemented as include_router()

4. Use APIROuter() and change everything
5. FASTAPI() add descriptions and make the route better

6. DOCUMENT: Create a document module (CRUD) also implemnent a upload functionality
    - Dont save any file, but save file name in db
    - Pydantic (doc_name)
    - Db models (id, doc_name)
    - make sure document is also include_router

7. Read about subprojects in FastAPI, how submodules/subprojects work in FaastAPI(https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/)

8. Start writing tests for User module
    - Unit tests using pytest
    - Tests should cover all scenarios
    - Properly configure unittests ()
    - Check whether we need to use TestClient or not, read documentation and make a summary.

9. If you have time, expand the unittests for Tasks
