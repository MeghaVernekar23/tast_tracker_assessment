1. Check whether you have these things before you proceed
    - Now you must have a working react app, fastapi server.
    - React app must have a login and once user logs in a dashboard must be displayed with his tasks
    - User must be able to create new tasks, delete and update tasks from UI
    - Fastapi server holds all backend code for User module and Tasks module
    - There are tests written for backend in pytest
    - There are docker containers with docker-compose.yaml file
    - Github pipeline which has stages (Linting, Testing and building stage)
        - The pipeline must have liniting
        - The pipeline must have pytests which runs as a seperate stage
        - The pipeline must build containers and check whether /health in backend works and /login in frontend works
    - DO NOT PROCEED IF THESE ARE NOT COMPLETED

2. Now please add a minimal cypress configurations to the react app
    - Write small tests to dashboard page
    - Automate the adding, deleting and updating the tasks via cypress

3. Once this is done, make a tag in Github with version as 1.0.0

4. Check and read about docker volumes as to how to properly mount them into the docker containers
    - Make the SqliteDB persistent(It should not be created new one the container restarts)

5. Read about CORS and see how to implemenet them in the Fastapi application.


Day6 task pending : - build stage - docker builds should happen
